I finally got the energy to build my own website to advertise myself and to showcase what I work on. I was really excited about using
[Astro](https://astro.build) for this project, and I wanted to see how much I liked it (spoiler alert: I like it a lot).

## Stack

This project uses **Astro** along with some **React** components that I wrote. I also used [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
to render my little computer guy on the main page (his name is Fred :D). The whole thing is pre-rendered, so no backend needed for this one.
It's also styled with **Tailwind**. 

## Features

The homepage features my name with some typing animation that I made with React, along with Fred the cave-bound terminal. I modeled Fred
using MagicaVoxel and then rendered him out with react-three-fiber, using [gltf-pipeline](https://github.com/CesiumGS/gltf-pipeline) to
lower the size of the model. My About page is rendered-out Markdown styled with Tailwind, nothing too fancy going on there. For my porfolio,
I'm using **Astro's content collections** to standardize my content so I can make the little preview cards and generate the pages from
Markdown or MDX. You can see how the schema contributes to the heading of this article!

```ts
import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content'

const portfolioSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  status: z.enum(['Complete', 'WIP']),
  description: z.string(),
  image: z.string().optional(),
  lastUpdated: z.date(),
  github: z.string().optional(),
  deployment: z.string().optional()
})
```

I also implemented the sorting features on the Portfolio page using [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to share state
between the control components and the React list.

## Status

I'm still working on this website and I want to improve it even more.

### Todo

- Make the home page have more than just a summary of myself. Add more cool stuff.
- ~Add a decent footer~ Improve the footer with things. Maybe navigation or Spotify integration?
- Improve responsive design.
- Optimize rendering strategy for Fred because for some reason it makes my Pagespeed score awful (the rest of the website is extremely fast
though!)
- Add the rest of my projects
- ~Add a way to sort my projects~
