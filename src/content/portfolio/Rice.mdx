This is a bit of a goofy project. I lived in a house with 12 people this year, and we had three separate rice cookers between us. People were
always making rice, and people always needed rice, but we never had a good system for tracking who was making rice or how much rice was being
made. As kind of a joke, I started making a web application to solve this (multiple people have told me that this is easily solved with a 
simple "I'm making rice, who wants some?" text, but I say that clogs up the group chat). 

## Stack

This project uses Sveltekit for the frontend + API routes and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for the database and authentication service.
Supabase has been awesome to use and the realtime functionality is super cool for a project like this. I'm also styling with Tailwind, and
I'm using [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/) for a UI toolkit. I've had a pretty great experience using Skeleton and it's made stuff like
modals and side bars really easy.

## Features

Users can create an account and sign in and out of the application. They can create a kitchen for their housemates and then create a rice event
when they plan on making rice. The rice event lasts for some amount of time that they can specify (e.g. 10 minutes), and then from there the
other house members have that amount of time to respond with whether they want rice and how much rice to add to the rice cooker.

This is all done with Supabase authentication and realtime subscriptions. When loading the page, the server makes the appropriate subscriptions
and passes them to the client. The main application also cannot be accessed if you are not signed in. Most of the functionality such as creating
a rice event is done using form actions rather than client-side fetch calls.

## Status

This project is very much not finished, and I want to work on it more when I have time as it's a cool realtime Supabase/Sveltekit demo that 
isn't just a chat app. I want to add stuff like push notifications and maybe convert it into a mobile-compatible PWA, although I'll be more
motivated if iOS Safari adds support for web push.

### Todo

- Add a way for users to join kitchens with short codes
- Add a way for users to respond rice events with how much rice they want
- Add a good summary view for people who are making rice
- PWA + push notification support
