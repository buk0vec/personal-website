This project is based off the objective reporting methods outlined in [Mastering Your Anxiety and Panic](https://academic.oup.com/book/1262)
that are used to track daily anxiety and worry levels along with occasional panic attacks. I made it because the strategy recommended by the
book is "just print out all these worksheets every day" which I don't think is very feasable for most people.

## Stack

I built this project using **Sveltekit, Tailwind, and Prisma**. I chose Sveltekit for my web framework since I've been getting pretty into
Svelte recently and I thought it would be a good choice for a smaller dashboard like this one. I also liked the way it handled form actions
which this project uses a lot of. I used Tailwind to do some quick and dirty styling for the project because I didn't want to spend a bunch
of time messing with CSS and I mostly wanted to focus on the features. I used Prisma to communicate with the database on the server side
which made managing the shape of my data and my queries a whole lot easier thanks to typesafety.

## Features

The dashboard is used for both daily check-ins and for panic attack reporting. The dashboard detects if you've already done a check-in for
the day, but allows you to make-up check-ins for previous days or resubmit check-ins if you want. The home page features a chart that plots
your average anxiety level per week that using Chart.js. Panic attack reporting is done using a specific set of parameters, and you can view
all your records in the "Records" tab.

All of the server requests are done through HTML form actions, meaning you can interact with the server w/o JS enabled. In fact, everything
minus the chart works without JS enabled (ex. cards auto-expand).

The site is also password protected with a basic cookie scheme. Without the proper cookie set, you cannot access the frontend nor the backend
routes thanks to Sveltekit's `hooks.server.ts`.

I also used responsive design with Tailwind to make the dashboard viewable on all screen sizes. For example, daily check-ins and panic attacks
on the "Records" tab are side-by-side on larger screens, but on smaller screens only one of the categories shows with a toggle to switch
between them. 

The project is deployed on Vercel, and Prisma is connected to a Postgres instance on Railway.

## Status

Mostly complete! The one thing I might add in the future is validation of my form actions with [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), along
with some less-minimalistic styling, but other than that I have all the features that I wanted in here.
