For my Intro to Software Engineering course, my group members and I decided to make a rough clone of [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) over
the course of roughly eight weeks. I took on the challenge of creating the backend using Express, along with handling CI/CD, monorepo setup,
and type generation.

## Stack

The backend was served with Express, which connected to a MongoDB Atlas cluster using Mongoose as the ORM. The monorepo, which included the
React w/ Vite frontend + ESLint configs + backend response types, was managed w/ [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/). We deployed the frontend
and backend on Azure w/ Github Actions. I also wrote a whole bunch of test cases using Jest to test object operations.

## Features

Most of the API features require user authentication, which is done by creating, validating, and setting JSON Web Tokens in a session cookie. 
Some routes, such as getting a page's content, are not protected, but most POST routes require the user to be logged in. All user and page
data is stored in MongoDB and accessed via Mongoose. 

```ts
// Page POST Authentication Guard
router.post("*", async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.cookies["Authorization"];
  if (token) {
    if (process.env.JWT_SECRET) {
      try {
        const decoded = verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        const username = typeof decoded == "string" ? decoded : decoded.name;
        if (res.locals != undefined) {
          res.locals.username = username;
          next();
        } else {
          res
            .status(503)
            .send({ error: true, message: "Internal server error" });
        }
      } catch {
        res.clearCookie("Authorization");
        res.status(401).send({ error: true, message: "Bad token" });
      }
    } else {
      res.status(503).send({ error: true, message: "Internal server error" });
    }
  } else {
    res.status(401).send({ error: true, message: "No token" });
  }
});
```

I had to create a whole bunch of POST routes to edit various aspects of the page, like adding/editing links or the theme, but I really didn't
want to create them all by hand. That's where [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) really came in handy. I was already using Zod to
validate the data coming into some of my endpoints, but I realized I could also use it to define and generalize a whole bunch of logic for
interacting with MongoDB. I created a `basePageUpdate` function that took in two args: a Zod schema and another function that took in a 
username and some data that needed to be added/updated/removed from MongoDB. `basePageUpdate` would then return a function that took in `req`
and `res` objects and handled my general server logic. 

```ts
type PageUpdater = (username: string, data: any) => any;

// Field updater for a page, takes in req res and a schema and updates an immediate field
// @eslint/no-unused-vars
const basePageUpdate = (schema: z.Schema, processor: PageUpdater) => {
  return async (req: express.Request, res: express.Response) => {
    const { username } = res.locals;
    const body = schema.safeParse(req.body);
    if (body.success) {
      try {
        const updated = await processor(username, body.data);
        if (updated) {
          res.status(200).send({
            error: false,
            message: "Page updated",
            body: updated,
          });
        } else {
          res.status(404).send({
            error: true,
            message:
              "Resource " +
              (body.data._id ? body.data._id : username) +
              " does not exist",
          });
        }
      } catch {
        res.status(503).send({ error: true, message: "Internal server error" });
        return;
      }
    } else {
      res.status(400).send({
        error: true,
        message:
          body.error.issues[0].path + " - " + body.error.issues[0].message,
      });
    }
  };
};
```

I could then easily create endpoints with this general logic to do various CRUD operations to the pages, saving a bunch of time:

```ts
export const pageTitleReqSchema = z
  .object({ title: z.string().min(1) })
  .strict();

router.post("/title", basePageUpdate(pageTitleReqSchema, updatePage));
```

I used Jest to test if my `PageUpdater` functions worked as intended, including if they handled DB connection errors, and I handled the 
CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions and Azure. The whole project was in a Turborepo monorepo and included a shared ESLint config between
the frontend and the backend. I also wrote types for all the responses from the API so the frontend team knew what to expect when they
interacted with it.

## Status

This was for a school project, took a lot of work, and I am happy to say that I am not touching it anymore!
