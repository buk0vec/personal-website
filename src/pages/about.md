I worked as a Student Lead at the Service Desk at Cal Poly Information Technology Services for three years during my undergrad.

In the summer of 2022, I was a Software Engineering and Data Science Intern at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working with the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics & Innovative Development division.

I'm looking for an internship for Summer 2025!
