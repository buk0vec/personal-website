# About Me

## Basics

I'm a undergraduate student at California Polytechnic State University, currently in my junior year of studying computer science. I'm originally from Seattle and I love the outdoors.

## Work

I'm looking for an internship for Summer 2023! I'm studying abroad for the Spring 2023 semester, so if you can't contact me by phone please try my email or LinkedIn!

I'm currently a Student Lead at the Service Desk at Cal Poly Information Technology Services

In the summer of 2022, I was a Software Engineering and Data Science Intern at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

I've also worked for the 2020 U.S. Census and as a volunteer for the non-profit organization South End Boxing Club.

## Skills

A whole bunch of stuff, including-but-not-limited-to: **JavaScript/Typescript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, React and NextJS, Svelte and SvelteKit, semantic HTML, CSS/Tailwind** (ok maybe I've been using a little too much Tailwind), **Jest and Cypress, Java, Python, importing pandas as pd and numpy as np, data analysis and machine learning, R, functional programming, enough C to get by...** but now we are stretching it a bit. At the end of the day, I am an **enthusiastic learner** and I love to learn about and try new things.
